# Roadmap

I am working incrementally toward a full implementation. I plan to
add semantics in a demand-led way (i.e. as I need it!). Currently,
serialisation is to/from OWL Presentation format only, but RDF
serialisation will be supported.

- 0.6 Infrastructure for parsable command line tools
- 0.7 More command line tools
- 0.8 RDF IO
